## Purpose

## How it Works

## History
Originally a Google project, much of the Kubernetes team came from the Google Borg team which had a similar goal. Launched in 2014 and currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) which was formed in 2015 by Google and the Linux foundation. Kubernetes means “helmsman” in Greek and the seven spoked wheel icon comes from both the name and that Kubernetes was known as “Project 7” internally at Google.
